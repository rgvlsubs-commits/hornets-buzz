---

## 3. Model Prediction

### Raw Calculation
```
Net Rating Differential: +8.4 - (-1.3) = +9.7 pts
Home Court: +2.0 pts
Elite Opponent Penalty: 0 (Hawks are weak)
Trade Deadline Adj: -0.5 (fading, expires soon)
─────────────────────────────
Predicted Margin: +11.2 pts
```

### Regime Analysis
```
Core 5 Active: YES
High Pace (231.5 O/U): MODERATE
Weak Opponent: YES (less variance)

Base σ (RSS): sqrt(11.5² + 3²) = 11.9
Margin boost: 0.20 × 11.2 = +2.2
Effective σ: 14.1
```

### Cover Probability
```
Spread: -5.5
Predicted Margin: +11.2
Expected Cover: +11.2 - 5.5 = +5.7 pts

Cover Prob: Φ(5.7 / 14.1) = 66%
```

### Win Probability (Moneyline)
```
Model Win Prob: Φ(11.2 / 14.1) = 79%
Implied Win Prob: 68.5%
Edge: +10.5%
```

---

## 4. EV Analysis

### Spread EV
```
Cover Prob: 66%
Spread EV = (0.66 × 100) - (0.34 × 110) = +28.6 per $100
```

### Moneyline EV
```
Win Prob: 79%
At -218: EV = (0.79 × 100) - (0.21 × 218) = +33.2 per $100
```

### Comparison
| Bet Type | EV per $100 | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **ML -218** | **+33.2** | **PREFERRED** |
| Spread -5.5 | +28.6 | Good value |

**Verdict:** Moneyline has higher EV. Unlike the Detroit game (underdog), here the ML is favored and has better value than spread.

## 5. Conviction Score

| Factor | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Normal Pace | +15 | 231.5 O/U is slightly elevated |
| Weak Opponent | +12 | Hawks NR -1.3 |
| Core 5 Fresh | +20 | 1 day since last Core 5 game |
| Well Rested | +10 | 1 day rest (not ideal, not B2B) |
| No Injuries | +10 | Core 5 expected healthy |
| Tail-Risk Haircut | -3 | σ=14.1 |
| **Total** | **64** | Medium-High Conviction |

---

## 6. Risk Factors

### Concerns
1. **Coming off a loss** - Emotional factor (could go either way)
2. **1 day rest** - Not ideal, but not B2B
3. **Trap game potential** - After tough Detroit loss, weak opponent could be letdown
4. **Covering 5.5** - Larger spread than we're used to betting

### Mitigating Factors
1. **Home game** - +2.0 pts advantage
2. **Weak opponent** - Hawks are below .500 with -1.3 NR
3. **Core 5 dominant** - 20-9 when healthy
4. **Model edge** - +11.2 predicted vs -5.5 spread

---

## 7. Recommended Strategy

### Pre-Game Bet (Lock In Now)

| Bet | Line | Units | Rationale |
|-----|------|-------|-----------|
| **Moneyline** | **-218** | **1.0** | Higher EV, model shows 79% win prob |
| **Spread** | **-5.5** | **0.5** | Secondary play, cover by 5.7 expected |

**Total Exposure:** 1.5 units (conservative after Detroit loss)

### Why Smaller Size Than Detroit?
1. Detroit was +3.0 underdog with CLV opportunity
2. This is -5.5 favorite - laying points, not getting them
3. After a loss, discipline matters more than chasing
4. Model still positive but favorite spreads have more variance

### Wait Signals
- Check Core 5 health before tip
- Watch for line movement toward -6 or -7 (would reduce value)
- Monitor if Hawks have any key injuries

---

## 8. Live Betting Triggers

### BUY Signals (Add Position)
| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Up 10+ at halftime | Add 0.5u spread if line is -2.5 or better |
| Hawks star (Trae Young) injured | Add 0.5u ML |
| Diabaté stays clean (0-1 fouls in Q1) | Confirms Core 5 stability |

### SELL Signals (Hedge/Exit)
| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Down at halftime | DO NOT hedge (expected variance) |
| Diabaté 3+ fouls Q1 | Consider small hedge |
| LaMelo injury | Exit/hedge immediately |
| Down 10+ at half | Hedge spread to limit loss |

---

## 9. Comparison to Detroit Game

| Factor | Detroit (Feb 9) | Atlanta (Feb 11) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Role | Underdog +3.0 | **Favorite -5.5** |
| Opp NR | +7.8 (Elite) | **-1.3 (Weak)** |
| Model Edge | +2.5 pts | **+5.7 pts** |
| Conviction | 65 | **64** |
| Outcome | Lost by 6 | TBD |
| Key Diff | Cunningham went off | Trae Young matchup |

**Key Insight:** We're on the other side now. Favorites cover less often than underdogs (vig works against you), but model shows clear edge.

---

## 10. Bottom Line

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Bet Quality** | **GOOD** - Model shows +5.7 cover, +10.5% ML edge |
| **Risk Level** | Medium (favorite spreads are harder) |
| **Sizing** | 1.5 units total (1.0 ML, 0.5 spread) |
| **Confidence** | 64/100 |

**Final Recommendation:**

```
BET NOW:
  - Moneyline -218: 1.0 unit
  - Spread -5.5: 0.5 unit

RESERVE:
  - 0.5 unit for live bet if up 10+ at half
```

**Rationale:** Model predicts +11.2 margin vs -5.5 spread. ML has better EV (+33 vs +29). Size conservatively after Detroit loss. Core 5 should handle weak Hawks team at home.

---

## 11. Post-Detroit Reflection

The Detroit loss (-6) was within our high-σ variance range. Key learnings:
1. Cunningham's 33-pt explosion was the difference
2. Our CLV was positive (+0.5) - we had the right read
3. High-variance games (σ=16.7) can go either way
4. Model was directionally correct (we were live at half)

**Atlanta is a reset opportunity** - weak opponent, home court, favorable model. Don't chase the Detroit loss, but don't be gun-shy either.
